ABOUT
-----

The redirector was originally developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0,
so having this environment is a prerequisite if you want to perform
a custom build on Windows systems

On Unix system, a Makefile.solaris and Makefile.linux are provided
and should be adapted to tailor to your own configuration.
Be sure to read the BUILDING.txt file, one directory up.


REQUIREMENT for Windows build
-----------------------------

MS VC 6.0 (+ update, latest service pack is 6)

BUILDING on Windows
-------------------

The steps that you need to take are:

   1. Change directory to the nsapi redirector plugins source directory.
   2. Set the IPLANET_HOME system environment value to iPlanet installation
      directory or edit the nsapi.dsp and replace all $(IPLANET_HOME)
      occurrences with the real path
   3. Execute the following command:
      nmake -f Makefile.vc [SO_VERSION=-1.2.46]

An alternative will be to open the isapi workspace file (nsapi.dsw) in msdev and
build it using the build menu.
