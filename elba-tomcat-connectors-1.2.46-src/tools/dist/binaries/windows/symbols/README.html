<h2><a name="symbols">Binary Diagnostic Symbol Downloads</a></h2>

<p>We now distribute a -symbols.zip file containing the precise
   debugging symbols corresponding to each released binary distribution.  
   For the typical user, there is no need to download these archives.
</p>

<p>These -symbols.zip packages contain the .pdb diagnostic symbol files (which
   correpsond to the distributed binary release) and can be used by nearly all
   modern Windows debugging tools, including the freely available WinDbg utility.
   They are most useful for the core developers to review crash dumps generated 
   by Dr. Watson if Apache experiences a General Protection Fault.  They also 
   provide additional backtrace details in Dr. Watson crash log files, if they
   are installed into the Apache directory which is experiencing General
   Protection Fault or other crash issues.
</p>

<p>If you don't understand a word of this, and a developer did not personally
   ask you to install them to help troubleshoot a problem, please trust that
   you do not need these files to install or run Apache Tomcat Connectors.
