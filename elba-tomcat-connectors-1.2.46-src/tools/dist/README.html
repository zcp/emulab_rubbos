<h2><a name="releases">Current Releases</a></h2>
<p>For details on current releases, please see the 
   <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi">Apache Tomcat
   Connectors Download Page</a>.
</p>
<p>Note; the -src.zip versions of Apache Tomcat Connectors are nearly identical to the
   .tar.gz versions. However, they offer the source files in DOS/Windows
   CR/LF text format, and include the Winows build files.
   These -src.zip files <strong>do NOT contain binaries!</strong>
   See the <a href="binaries/windows/">binaries/windows/</a>
   directory for the Windows binary distributions.

<h2><a name="archive">Older Releases</a></h2>
<p>Only current, recommended releases are available on www.apache.org
   and the mirror sites.  Older releases can be obtained from the

<h2><a name="sig">PGP Signatures</a></h2>
<p>You <strong>must</strong> verify the integrity of the downloaded files.
   We provide OpenPGP signatures for every release file.  This signature should
   be matched against the
   <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-connectors/KEYS">KEYS</a>
   file which contains the OpenPGP keys of the Release Managers. We also
   provide an <code>SHA1</code> and <code>SHA512</code> checksum for every
   release file. After you download the file, you should calculate a checksum
   for your download, and make sure it is the same as ours.
